The MSS54 families (MSS54, MSS54HP, MSS54HP CSL) can run any software within the same family.

What this means is that should one want to upgrade (or downgrade for that matter), one can simply flash the full binary, THEN the desired partial if needed, to your MSS54/HP/CSL.

The MSS54HP CAN run the MSS54HP CSL software by way of flashing a modified full binary. However with no H-Bridge in on the ECU, the flap will not be functional. There are people out there that will solder on an H-Bridge. To flash the MSS54HP CSL software onto the MSS54HP, [click here.](https://github.com/saildot4k/MSS54-XDFs/tree/master/Unmodified%20BIN%20Dumps%20-%20Full/MSS54HP%20to%20CSL)


NOTE: Looking for more full binaries. 
[Current Hosted Binaries](https://github.com/saildot4k/MSS54-XDFs/tree/master/Unmodified%20BIN%20Dumps%20-%20Full)

NOTE: Once the full binary is flashed, please flash the tune (or partial as it is known) of your choice back to match your needs.
